# Python Software Setup
## Python Software
There are many ways to run Python code. It can run on a basic terminal or in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many IDEs to choose from but for this course we are using Spyder.

 

## Windows - Spyder
There are hundreds of ways to run Python code on various platforms and environments. From your PC to your web browser, to your Linux terminal. We will use one of the most well-known Python platforms, Anaconda. If you are familiar with Python and have it installed already, use what you are comfortable with.

If you don't have Python installed and this is your first time with Python then follow the following steps:
- To install Anaconda, go to this[link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and click on the download button. By default, the option is for Windows, however you can install it on Linux and MacOS.
- Once it has finished installing, open and run the file. You should then see the setup, select Next:

- You should now see Anaconda added to your recently added apps in the Windows start menu. Select Anaconda Navigator:
- It will take some time load, then you will see the following:

You will see many programs that Anaconda has installed for you including Python. All are focused on data science. We will be using the Spyder Python environment. It has one very useful feature called the variable explorer which is like a an Excel sheet built into the environment so you can see your data and interact with it. It is also very similar to Matlab. Select Spyder, and wait for it to load.

## Python libraries

if you're familiar with Python and want to install individual Python libraries. The ones used are:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- sympy
- sklearn
  
Note, that these are all installed by default with Anaconda. For other libraries like `tensorflow` you can go to the Anaconda Environment tab and install them there or use the Anaconda console. If you are using a Python console you can use ```pip install tensorflow``` for example.
