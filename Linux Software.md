# Linux Software Setup
## Terminals in Windows
There are many ways to run a simulated Linux terminal in Windows and even installing Linux inside windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For this training we try a simpler approach.

## Preferred Option - GitBash

We will use GitBash which comes pre-installed if you install Git. This can be obtained by clicking on the [link](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.43.0.windows.1/Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe)

Once downloaded it should appear in your downlods folder.
Double click on the app to run the application. You should see the following in which you select Next:

Choose the destination where you want to install it, preferably stick with the default C:/ drive location and select Next:

For "default editor" choose "Nano" editor and then Next

For next windows that appear just select Next:

And then finally...it will install:

To run it select the Finish button with "Launch Git Bash" selected:

Note, there are other online Linux terminal simulations you can use. Feel free to use them too.

- You don't need to install the bash terminal in Linux it comes pre-installed. Search for your Terminal in your start-up menu.
- You don't need to install the bash terminal on Mac, a similar one called ZSH comes pre-installed. Click on your launchpad, then search for terminal
